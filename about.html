				<h1>ABOUT ERNEST OBOH</h1>
				<div class="container">
					<p id="homePage_text">
						With nearly 20 years experience in banking, Ernest Osezua Oboh could easily be classified as one of the professionals of the present era. At a time most people were taking advantage of the growth in the Nigerian financial service landscape to change jobs almost every year, Ernest found wisdom in staying and contributing to the growth of the then newly established Oceanic International Bank.

						Having joined the bank after his NYSC, Ernest took a long look ahead and bought into the vision of the institution of transforming into one of the biggest financial services providers in Nigeria.

						Armed with a calm personality, a thorough mind and a Higher National Diploma in Estate Management from Auchi Polytechnic, Auchi, Edo State. He joined the bank in June of 1990 as an Administrative Assistant with a brief to ensure proper maintenance of the banks guest houses and new business offices. While working in this capacity, hs relationship and management skill was quickly spotted, a development that led to deployment to the Credit and Marketing department of the bank began its rapid expansion drive, Ernest was drafted, along with a few other high performing staff to Apapa as spearheads of the bank's business in Nigeria's maritime hub. The brief, this time was to ensure that the bank firmly plants its roots into Nigeria's major import and export gateway.

						His contributions to the growth of the bank in this region, especially in the areas of liability generation and credit analyses was spotted by the management of the bank, prompting his posting back to the head office to help oversee the bank's risk management portfolio. Here he was asked to take charge of monitoring bank-wide credit risks as well as recovery of loans.

						It was in this critical department of the bank that Ernest gained a very good understanding of credit policy issues and the operational dynamics of risk asset products and services of the county's financial services industry.

						By the first quarter of 2006, Ernest who had obtained an MBA in Marketing in 1996 from the Lagos State University was deployed as the Head of a new unit called Branch Network and which was responsible for the rapid expansion of the bank across all the country. His mandate was to provide all necessary support services needed for the establishment of new business offices and the relocation of new ones.

						This was perhaps where his background as an Estate Manager (Estate Surveyor and Valuer) became even more useful. With a firm knowledge of the properties market and strong negotiating skills, he successfully worked with vendors, different layers of community people and regulatory bodies in minimizing infractions associated with property acquisitions and business office construction and roll-out competitive value for the bank.

						Ernest is presently the Managing Partner of Oboh Ernest & Associates, a firm of Estate Surveyors and Valuers duly recognized and given the instruments of the Nigeria Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV) and the Estate Surveyors and Valuers Registration Board of Nigeria (ESVARBON) respectively; to practice professional service in estate surveying and valuation throughout the federation. We have maintained a wide and robust practice with a prompt quality service delivery and a mechanism to check and measure performance. We operate from Suite 1 - 199, Road 5, Ikota Shopping Complex, Victoria Garden City, Lekki, P.O. Box 55033, Falomo, Ikoyi.

						Born on April 6, 1961, in present Esan Central Local Government Area of Edo State, he is married to Joan and both are blessed with three children.
